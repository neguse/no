## requirements to implement questions

* read one line from stdin
  * items are separated by space
* output to stdout
* make literal
* add, sub
* make function
* call function
  * recurse
* string insertion, deletion

## basic policy

* simple implementation
  * both questions and language processor

## specification

* operations, variables, system functions will be represented by single character
* single symbol will represents only single mean
* syntax tree generated by parser will be binary tree
* a program is array of expression
* output is value of evaluation of last expression

## types

* integer
* list
  * string is represented as list of integer

## operations

```
symbol (`r`oot or `l`eaf) : meaning

= (r) : assignment(definition)

~ (r) : call function
\ (r) : create function(lambda)
_ (l) : indicator of no arguments on function call
( (r) : begin of arguments on function
, (l) : delimiter of arguments on function
) (l) : end of arguments of function

+ (r) : add
- (r) : sub

? (r) : if
: (r) : then

```

## system functions, constants

called by `~`

I : read
C : cons
A : car
D : cdr
N : nil

## syntax

ebnf

```
program    = { expression }
expression = assign_exp | call_exp | lambda_exp | op_exp | if_exp | literal
assign_exp = "=" ident expression
call_exp   = "~" expression arg_list
lambda_exp = "\" arg_list expression 
arg_list   = "(" { expression "," } ")"
op_exp     = op expression expression
op         = "+" | "-"
if_exp     = "?" expression ":" expression expression
```
